An android application for Students to manage and get information about events in an organization.

The objective behind creating this application is to provide a common platform for all the students and management through which they can gather all the information regarding the events that will take place in a particular university or an organization.
- This will save a lot of time by providing an easy platform for students to register for the events they are interested in and for the management to create the events.
- The application will give an easy and secure payment option to the students which will save them from the last minute rush.

## Introduction
Our application is a 3 user level application.

The 3 user level are as follows: 1) Admin  2)Faculty   3)Students

- The Admin level is for managing all the events, registration for the various events and workshops, sponsorships for the Fest and the users signing up for the fest.
- The faculty level is for creating the events and various competitions which will make the fest much more interesting.
- Also, they will manage all the payments done by the user for the events.
- The user level is for creating account in the application and for registering for various events and competitions that are being held.

## Real-time Application

- The real time usage of the application will be in the colleges and universities for the better management of the programs and events. 
- It is an efficient solution for the problems like sending mails and messages for every event and then standing in long queues for registration. Also Admin will get a platform to know about every event going to happen in the organization, also eliminating lots of paperwork. 
- The application will be designed as a general application which can be adapted by any university and they can use it in their respective festivals.
